- Shell-scripting, based on Linux, Raspbian.
- Distribution of Debian.
- Loads of different projects to learn.

---- 

## Choosing a Project
- Something you're interested in; could even use in day-to-day .
- DIY Parking sensor, DIY Theremin, Motion Capture and Wire Game.
- Collaborating on these projects are the best way to get them done.

----
## Motion Capture on a Raspberry PI
- Setting up OpenCV and googling how it all fits together
- Plugging in the camera and debugging
- Finding out what the code is doing for yourself and editing examples

---
# Wire Loop Game

---
- Scratch 3; built in integration for electronics kits (Arduino's and Raspberry PIs)
- Demo made alongside Fatima, a member in my team
- A break from the day-to-day (BAU)
---
## Recipe
### Ingredients:
- Raspberry Pi 3+, Raspbian Bullseye or greater!
- 2x; Jumper to Jumper Cables
- 2x; Jumper to Pin Cables
- 2x; 3mm Crocodile Clip
- 1x; Buzzer
- 1x; Metallic Wire 
- 1x; Paper Clip

### Method
- Copy this diagram for the correct wiring positions
- *INSERT DIAGRAM*
- Plug in the PI and make sure it's booting up to the sunny desktop
- Open the terminal and make sure you can run Scratch3
- Load the project, simple-wire-loop
- Ensure the jumpers are connected and try and keep the buzzer quiet!

### Notes & Challenges
- Can you make a score-system based off time somehow?
- Is it possible to modulate the buzzer's pitch?
- Can you integrate other bits of the DIY kits into the diagram?
